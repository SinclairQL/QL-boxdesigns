# QL Box Recreations

This repo contains the recreated Sinclair QL software boxes as vector graphics. Head over to the [QL Forum thread](https://qlforum.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=2632&sid=ef681f8119139605c057f3192d76916f) to learn more about it.

They are recreated from photos or scans provided by various nice people (thanks RalfR!). Most of it is then overlayed on top of the bitmap and vectors re-created in [Affinity Designer for Windows](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/). The artwork itself is usually more complex (and way over my artistic skills) so I use [Vector Magic](https://vectormagic.com/) to get me a starting poing.

There are be sub-directories for the various titles. In them you will find the exported SVG, PDF and also a PNG version. As the original Designer sources are rather big you can find them on my [Shared OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AgxrZW7zjbUwjtFMqTEP0Ece9BnrkA)
